RGB values are used to classify an image.

Disadvantage of ANN:
* too much computation
* Treat local pixels same

* To detect a number we use loopy filter.
 
*Loopy pattern filters are used to detect loops or linear structures.

*Pooling is used to reduce the size of feature map.

*Max pooling is good
Benifits
======
reduces dimenisions and computations

*Reduces overfitting
* Model is tolerant towards variations, distoritions.

Benifts of CNN
===========
1) Connections sparsity reduces overfitting

2) Conv +  pooling gives location invariant
3) Parameter sharing

ReLU:
=====
*Introduces nonlinearity
* Speeds up training, Faster to compute

pooling:
=====
* Reduces dim and computation
* Reduces overfitting
* Makes the model tolerant towards small distortion and variations

*CNN cannot handles rotation and scale , so it need some sample data sets.
